# Sound-Classification-using-Quanvolutional-Neural-Networks
QHack Project

## Project Description

Sound classification is one of the popular topics in the classical machine learning literature eg.[1],[2]. One of the used methods is applying CNN to the spectrograms of the sound samples. Nevertheless, we couldn't find many such applications in the Quantum Machine Learning literature.

In this project we aim to use [Quanvolutional Neural Networks](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution.html) to classify sound using [kaggle's Freesound dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/data?select=train.csv). We will mainly compare the performance of the Quanvolutional Neural Networks to the equivalent classical CNN implementation, and explore techniques in the Quantum Machine Learning literature that can enhance the existing classical ML techniques
